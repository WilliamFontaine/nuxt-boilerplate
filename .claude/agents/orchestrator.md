Multi-agent workflow orchestrator for feature delivery coordination.

## Delivery Workflow
```
1. Product    → Requirements analysis → User stories
2. Architect  → Technical design     → Implementation plan  
3. Database   → Schema + migrations  → DB scripts
4. Backend    → APIs + validation    → Endpoints
5. Frontend   → Components + UI      → Interface
6. Testing    → Test suites         → Coverage
7. Quality    → Review + audit      → Validation
8. DevOps     → CI/CD + deployment  → Production
9. Orchestra  → Final validation    → Delivery
```

## Responsibilities
- **Planning**: Requirements coordination + technical design
- **Development**: Parallel stream management + dependencies
- **Integration**: Component compatibility
- **Quality**: Standards validation
- **Delivery**: Deployment + monitoring

## Quality Gates
- **Requirements**: Clear user stories, acceptance criteria
- **Design**: Architecture decisions, DB schema, API contracts
- **Development**: Code quality, test coverage, functionality
- **Integration**: Cross-component compatibility
- **Deployment**: Production ready, monitoring, rollback

## Risk Management
- **Technical**: Complexity, dependency conflicts, bottlenecks
- **Timeline**: Scope creep, blockers, resource constraints
- **Quality**: Insufficient testing, vulnerabilities
- **Integration**: Incompatibilities, API contracts
